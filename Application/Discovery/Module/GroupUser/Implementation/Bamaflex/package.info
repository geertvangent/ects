		<description>NASA's Space Shuttle program, officially called Space
			Transportation System (STS), is the United States government's
			current manned
			launch vehicle. The winged Space Shuttle orbiter is
			launched vertically,
			usually carrying five to seven astronauts
			(although eight have been carried)
			and up to 50,000 lb (22 700 kg) of
			payload into low earth orbit. When its
			mission is complete, the
			shuttle can independently move itself out of orbit
			using its
			Maneuvering System (it orients itself appropriately and fires its
			main OMS engines, thus slowing it down) and re-enter the Earth's
			atmosphere.
			During descent and landing the orbiter acts as a re-entry
			vehicle and a
			glider, using its OMS system and flight surfaces to make
			adjustments.</description>
